            As the official historian for a new colony world its your privilege to record the events and preserve the unique heritage of what will no doubt be a thriving and successful community. Boundless opportunity and a place in history are with in your reach as you work side by side with your fellow colonists. I envy you a bright future on the colony world XB-137, surely in no time at all...

            Ugh, official messages from the central worlds can be so overwrought; do they expect anyone to actually read them?  You are too busy for this nonsense, you have a mandatory session with the Health and Wellness Android today and you have profiles on the Colony Biologist and Pastor to get started on.
