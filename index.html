Boundless opportunity and a place in history are with in your reach as you work side by side with your fellow colonists.

              Ugh, official messages from the central worlds can be so overwrought; do they expect anyone to actually read them?  You are too busy for this nonsense, you have a mandatory session with the Health and Wellness Android today and you have profiles on the Colony Biologist and Pastor to get started on.

                TB: Its perfectly normal to flounder around at during these things. Particularly with a non-human, I'm shore we'll be chums before long.  I'll tell you what, why don't we push this appointment off until tomorrow afternoon. Sea you then!

                Looks like you're schedule has been re-arranged for you. Hopefully the biologist won't mind if you start with her.

                You follow the busy scientist for several hour checking over the massive tanks and the algae they contain before heading over to the common to catch the first spiritual session lead by Ali.
