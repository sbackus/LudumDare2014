              As the official historian for a new colony world its your privilege to record the events and preserve the unique heritage of what will no doubt be a thriving and successful community. Boundless opportunity and a place in history are with in your reach as you work side by side with your fellow colonists.

              Ugh, official messages from the central worlds can be so overwrought; do they expect anyone to actually read them?  You are too busy for this nonsense, you have a mandatory session with the Health and Wellness Android today and you have profiles on the Colony Biologist and Pastor to get started on.

            TB: Hello. Welcome to your first session, my chosen name is Miranda.  Remember nothing here is verboaten you should feel free to express yourself.  Lets dive in.

            You: Uh...

            TB: Its perfectly normal to flounder around at during these things. Particularly with a non-human, I'm shore we'll be chums before long.  I'll tell you what, why don't we push this appointment off until tomorrow afternoon. Sea you then!

            Looks like you're schedule has been re-arranged for you. Hopefully the biologist won't mind if you start with her.
