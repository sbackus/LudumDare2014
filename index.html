                You find Miranda wired directly into a terminal near the computer core for the colony ship.  The android seems sluggish and takes a minute to notice you've arrived. Once you are noticed a nearby screen flickers to life. It turns out a large portion of Miranda's considerable processing capability has been dedicated to running image enhancement algorithms on the incoming hatchery video. A fortunate turn of events for you the views of the newborn fish are extra adorable while the overdone ocean puns are notably absent.  You spend a pleasant evening enjoying fish and each others company. As you depart for the night Miranda mentions it was a reel-y great evening.

                You arrive in the darkened cargo bay to find Ali gesturing excitedly towards a container. As you approach he opens the lid. Inside in miniature is a cunningly crafted model of the colony from the former ship itself to mining facility in the foot hills. All the fiddly details are there and it doesn't take you long to locate the window to your room. After a few moments of silent inspection Ali points out that the Algae farm needs some work and the surrounding terrain needs to be filled in. You are quickly sucked into the project and spend the evening how beg borrow or steal scarce materials to help with the project.

                A few days after movie night you ask Dr Chamoun if she would walk with you around the colony. Along the way you spot some plants that seem to be dying. She notices your interest and explains. "As far as we can tell it's normal for the particular species to suddenly sicken and die. The rapid aging seems to allow the plant to better adapt to environmental changes." She ends with "And so we are all connected in the great Circle of Life." You suspect a movie reference.

                Later that night you do a bit of research and find that your hunch was correct. The quote appears to be from an old animation titled The Lion King. Unfortunately the techs who put together the cultural database for your colony decided to omit it and you have to make do with a wiki article.
