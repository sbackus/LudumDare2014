Boundless opportunity and a place in history are with in your reach as you work side by side with your fellow colonists. I envy you a bright future on the colony world XB-137, surely in no time at all...

              Ugh, official messages from the central worlds can be so overwrought; do they expect anyone to actually read them?  You are too busy for this nonsense, you have a mandatory session with the Health and Wellness Android today and you have profiles on the Colony Biologist and Pastor to get started on.

                TB: Its perfectly normal to flounder around at during these things. Particularly with a non-human, I'm shore we'll be chums before long.  I'll tell you what, why don't we push this appointment off until tomorrow afternoon. Sea you then!

Currently we've have a crop of Tomatoes almost ready to harvest, but even with the compressed growth cycle the greenhouse can't produce material as quickly as some of our other efforts.

                TB: Hello again.  Don't you think its fishy that there is currently only one marine biologist for the entire colony?  There dolphinitly should be a higher priority on aquatic matters.  Its probably a fluke of some sort, maybe mention it to Dr Chamoun at some point.

                Seems like Miranda just wants to talk about fish. You spend the rest of the meeting talking about aquatic life and the colony fish hatchery afterward you head over to the common room to find Ali.
