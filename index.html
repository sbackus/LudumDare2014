You are too busy for this nonsense, you have a mandatory session with the Health and Wellness Android today and you have profiles on the Colony Biologist and Pastor to get started on.

                You find Miranda wired directly into a terminal near the computer core for the colony ship.  The android seems sluggish and takes a minute to notice you've arrived. Once you are noticed a nearby screen flickers to life. It turns out a large portion of Miranda's considerable processing capability has been dedicated to running image enhancement algorithms on the incoming hatchery video. A fortunate turn of events for you the views of the newborn fish are extra adorable while the overdone ocean puns are notably absent.  You spend a pleasant evening enjoying fish and each others company. As you depart for the night Miranda mentions it was a reel-y great evening.

Inside in miniature is a cunningly crafted model of the colony from the former ship itself to mining facility in the foot hills. All the fiddly details are there and it doesn't take you long to locate the window to your room. After a few moments of silent inspection Ali points out that the Algae farm needs some work and the surrounding terrain needs to be filled in. You are quickly sucked into the project and spend the evening how beg borrow or steal scarce materials to help with the project.
